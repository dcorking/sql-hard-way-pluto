## Some practice SQL code

These are my attempts at the tutorials in the book ['Learn SQL The Hard Way'(http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/), by Zed Shaw.

Most, if not all, of the code is copyright Zed Shaw, 2011, all rights reserved, and is re-used here for educational purposes. None of the text of the book is here, only some code, often highly modified. The original author says: "You are free to read this book, but you can't give it out to anyone else or host it yourself".

## Spoiler warning

Some of the code may be spoilers for exercises in books and tutorials.
